--Task: Write a query that gives an overview of how many films have replacements costs in the following cost ranges (low: 9.99 - 19.99 medium: 20.00 - 24.99 high: 25.00 - 29.99)
--Question: How many films have a replacement cost in the "low" group?
SELECT
	CASE
		WHEN REPLACEMENT_COST <= 19.99 THEN 'Low'
		WHEN REPLACEMENT_COST BETWEEN 20.00 AND 24.99  THEN 'Medium'
		ELSE 'High'
	END AS "Rating",
	COUNT(REPLACEMENT_COST) AS "Total_Count"
FROM
	FILM
WHERE
	CASE
		WHEN REPLACEMENT_COST <= 19.99 THEN 'Low'
		WHEN REPLACEMENT_COST BETWEEN 20.00 AND 24.99  THEN 'Medium'
		ELSE 'High'
	END = 'Low'
GROUP BY
	CASE
